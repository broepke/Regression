# Learn Excelâ€™s Hidden, yet Powerful Tools for Linear Regression

**Linear Regression** is the most common type of regression analysis and is an incredibly powerful tool. On smaller projects or business-oriented use cases, you might find a [simple linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression) model using **Excel** is the perfect tool for you to complete your analysis quickly.

Regression analysis helps you examine the relationship between two or more variables. We use `y` to represent the **dependent variable** and `X` to represent the **independent variable**. The dependent variable `X` is the one that is fixed in nature or inputs into your model, and the `y` variable is the one that you are predicting with the model. 

* **Independent** variables are also known as *predictor* or *explanatory* variables.
* **Dependent** variables are also known as *response* variables. 

It is also common with a simple linear regression model to utilize the [Ordinary Least Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares) (**OLS**) method for fitting the model. In the **OLS** method, the model's accuracy is measured by the sum of squares for the residuals of each predicted point. The residual is the orthogonal distance between the point in the dataset and the fitted line.
